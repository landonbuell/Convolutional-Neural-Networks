	This Folder contains all projects related to Number Classfiers

--------------------------------

This folder can mostly be ignored - 
	These are old programs that I did not use directly for research
	They use the MNIST-10 dataset : https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist
	I used these to indtroduce to myself how to use Neural Networks

--------------------------------

You can use these codes to understand a "pythonic" implementation of networks
	See where I started and how I progressed through math/programming/Results
