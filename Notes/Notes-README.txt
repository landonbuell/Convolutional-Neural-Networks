Solution: Error-Compensation-Attacks
Landon Buell - 1 Sept 2020

	This Folder contains all LATEX files related to notes and papers

--------------------------------

This Folder contains no programs/simultions
	Contains mostly LATEX files & documents that I used for "Deliverabes"
	The notes in here may be useful for filling in any gaps in neural networks
	Citations are all included in the bottom of each document

--------------------------------

Folders can be used:
	"Activation_Modifications"  
		Details on older types of attack functions that I used in the MLP model
		(very old, mostly for my URC presentation)

	"Metrics_and_benchmarks" 
		My 'paper' on metrics, with a functions that can be used to evaliate the performance
			of a neural network
		This will be useful for filling in what precision/recall/loss, etc. mean
	
	"Optimizer"
		Optimizers are algorithms that "train" Neural Networks.
		This may be useful if you need to implement your own python Nueral network
		Explains the mathematical end of how nueral networks learn.
